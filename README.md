# silverstripe-gridfield-extradata

Silverstripe module providing a mechanism to define extra data during GridField definition that will be passed to objects created via the grid field.

Comes with a predefined GridFieldConfig that handles orderable and addnewmulticlass aspects of symbiote/silverstripe-gridfieldextensions.

Somewhat experimental, particularly when utilising addnewmulticlass. Test your implementation thoroughly before using in production.
